AutoAnimate is fundamentally a single function — `autoAnimate` — that accepts a parent element. Automatic animations will be applied to the parent element and its immediate children. Animations are specifically triggered when one of three events occurs:

- A child is **added** in the DOM.
- A child is **removed** in the DOM.
- A child is **moved** in the DOM.
