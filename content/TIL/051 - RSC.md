## Client-Side Rendering

In a typical SPA, when a client makes a request, the server sends a single HTML page to the browser (the client). 

This HTML page often contains just a simple div tag a reference to a JavaScript file. 

This JavaScript file contains everything your application needs to run, including the React library itself and your application code. 

It is downloaded when the HTML file is parsed.

The downloaded JavaScript code then generates the HTML on your computer and inserts it into the DOM under the root div element and you see the user interface in the browser.

Drawbacks: SEO + Performance

## Server-Side Rendering

Instead of sending a nearly empty HTML file that depends on client-side JavaScript to construct the page, the server takes charge of rendering the full HTML. 

This fully-formed HTML document is then sent directly to the browser. Since the HTML is generated on the server, the browser is able to quickly parse and display it, improving the initial page load time.
