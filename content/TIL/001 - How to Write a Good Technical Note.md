- **Comprehensive Context**: Original requirements, prior knowledge, existing solutions, specific practices, and reference literature.
- **Reproducibility**: Complete demonstration of the environment setup process, all command-line parameters, complete command-line output, and full source code with compilation parameters.
- **Documenting Failures**: Even if unsuccessful, record the "entire" attempted process leading up to the failure.
- **In-Depth Details:** Delve into the details, elaborate on the challenges encountered.
- **Continuity**: Iterating through experiences in an ongoing manner is the best practice.
- **Reference Material**: Avoid leaving only links for reference. It is preferable to include titles, authors, dates, and links.
