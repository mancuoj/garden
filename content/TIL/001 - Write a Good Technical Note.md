> A technical document that fails to guide related work after three months or more is fundamentally flawed.

- **Comprehensive Context**: Include the original requirements, background knowledge, existing solutions, applied practices, and relevant literature to provide a full picture.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure the document details the environment setup, all command-line inputs, outputs, and the complete source code with its compilation parameters for easy replication.
- **Documenting Failures**: Record the entire process, including unsuccessful attempts, to provide valuable insights into what didn't work.
- **In-Depth Details**: Dive deep into the specifics, discussing the challenges faced and how they were addressed or why they remained unresolved.
- **Continuity**: Adopt a practice of continuously updating the document with new findings and experiences for ongoing relevance.
- **Reference Material**: Instead of merely linking to references, include the title, author(s), publication date, and the link to ensure the information remains accessible and understandable over time.
