## Aliyun

```sh
ssh root@ip [-p 22]

adduser user
usermod -aG sudo user

# Log in with the created user
ssh user@ip
```

Establish passwordless login, if the directory or file doesn't exist, create it.

```sh title="~/.ssh/config"
Host serverAlias
	Hostname ip
	User user
```

Generate a key if not available and copy it to the server.

If already present, copy directly.

```sh
# Generating a key can be done with default settings
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id serverAlias
```

Now, logging in is as simple as using the specific alias with `serverAlias`.

```sh
ssh serverAlias
```

## AWS

```sh
chmod 400 xx.pem
ssh -i "xx.pem" ubuntu@ip
```

To enable password login.

```sh
# Set a password for the default user
sudo passwd ubuntu

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Change no to yes
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Save, exit and restart the service
sudo service sshd restart
```

Then, log in with `sudo ubuntu@ip` (or configure passwordless login similar to the Alibaba Cloud instructions above).
