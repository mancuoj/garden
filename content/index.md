Hi, I'm mancuoj. A ~~amateur~~ frontend engineer working in Shanghai, China. The cybergarden you've stumbled upon is a repository of my learning journey - a collection of musing, fleeting thoughts, and whimsical ideas.

I strived to maintain a singular focus on the frontend ecosystem, channeling my energy into understanding and mastering its intricacies. This space serves as a digital oasis where I cultivate knowledge and document the ebb and flow of my progress.

Here are some places you may want to visit:
